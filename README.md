# StarburstPy

StarburstPy is a python wrapper for Starburst99 (Leitherer et al. (1999), Leitherer et al. (2014)).
    
The Starburst99 Fortan code must be downloaded and compiled before this will work. See http://www.stsci.edu/science/starburst99/docs/default.htm for the Starburst99 code and instructions on how to compile it.
    
I do not maintain the Starburst99 code so I cannot answer (most) technical questions about it. Questions about Starburst99 should be directed to Claus Leitherer.

Install using:

pip install StarburstPy

Questions about StarburstPy should be directed to me, the author.
